<!-- 
1. The first thing we do we create tag header with class header: header.header for navigation (under header means top thing aka navigation)

2. It is good rule to give a class/name to most tags, it make easy to work with them later, like apply property to them.

3. It is not a good practise to create .container for whole document. Better way to create same size container for different features in a page. Optimum widht 1200px. This size is good for human eye. 
<header class="header">
        <div class="container">

4. Creating logo and menu. You might think to put inside empty .container element but not, because you only use it for creating size of that container width 1200. 
In this case you create one more div.header__iner
  <header class="header">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="header__iner">
                and put inside logo and menu

5. header__iner  use double underscore as bem method, there are many other methods. - or _ but use __ : block is header and inside of it there is element header__iner and if wants to modiffy origginal use -- so it is header--popular

-6. Logo is always link, so we put image teg between a tag.

-7. for navigation around website use tag <nav> with class menu. it convention (from back in the day) to do as list ul li and inside anchors 

-8. class put right after opening tag: <img class="logo__img" src="images/logo.jpg" alt="logo">

9. Shortcuts:  w33.3%  h50  bgc  div#od  p0-10  mr70  m0-0-60

10. !!! * {           the first line in css file
    box-sizing: border-box; or content-box;
    If border-box it is fix size and affect inword and if content-box the size is increasing outword
    standart set to content-box but for markup is better to set border-box
}

11. locate block in the middle use margin: 0 auto; where 0 - top & bottom and auto - will lead to repel from left & right to the middle as much as possible

12. !! width: 1200px it is not good practise to use static (constant) width, because it is not just being used on big displays, but also work on mobile devises as well. So instead we use max-width: 1200px, so when there is big screen it will use 1200, otherwise it will use whatever it can.

13. The most left edge of display in mobile devices too close to edge of phone so we need to make room from left side till text, it achives by using padding: 0 10px; 10px is optimum value for space. Also if there is set width 1200 then we have to increase by 20 because of padding

14. !!!! Every tag in html by default assign curtain padding and marging. It has done back in the day. So to solve this problem (but it does not completely set everything to 0, some still have p and m) need to download normalize css and !! important to insert before style.css otherwise it will override your style if you put normalize below

15 display: flex; locate blocks in a row

16 justify-content: space-betwen; will locate 2 blocks on the ends

17 Figma to see distance we select Inspection tab then select edge and than press and hold key Opt

18. ul has padding on the left where markers are so we put pl0, as well margin to 0; together with * we put them at the begining like standart.

19. list-style: none; to remove bullets from unordered list

20. If logo and text in different levels (vertically) to center them, inside the flexible container align-items: center 
She said that justify-content positions elements across the horizontal axis because the word itself is longer than align-items.

- 21. Color for anchor or text good practice to use color: inherit; If we want all navigation the same color, we assign value for main div and the rest is just inherit. 
Inheritance apply from the nearest div. Because link usually blue color

22. From lower case to upper case - we use text-transform: uppercase;

23. In body we set text size, font ... and downloading them from google fonts, adding bold if needed, see in figma all possible text weight. 
Put that font in body, not just in link.
Font-size, color, line-height

24. !! selector1 + selector2 {}, here + means 2nd selector. .menu__item + .menu__item How does it work. It search for selector1, then it looks for 2nd selector and it only apply properties to 2nd selector. It very handy when we do not want to apply property to all elements but only for specific elements. 1 element -50- 2 element -50- 3 element -20-     We originaly apply them 20 it creates 40 then we need 10 so we use this combination

Applying padding-top: 50px; for all but first .info__item + .info__item

! Margin and Padding is same thing you only see difference when there is backround color, otherwise it is white. Use margin: auto to center it.

25. !! With help of padding to anchor as well as assigning color to :hover it is create rectangular shape of hover effect. And we  can change size of rectangular with padding.

26. Transition need to make it slowly changes effect instead of momentarally 

27. Pixels - photos when you zoom in it shows squares and quality worsen. Unlike in vector images - they created from lines, curves when you zoom them they always in a good quality. 

28. !! Jpeg is smaller in a size but does not have transperency (white background) unlike in PNG but it is a bigger size.

29. if we add hidden in a class. It will hide everything inside that class <div> class="modal hidden"</div> and if we remove it then it will show. But before that we need to add .hidden {display: none;}

30. When we create general empty div/section in which will be located relative elements to this div. So for this one we assign padding to div above and down: 100px 0 150px;

31. When use Flex need use flex-basis instead of width. It is almost synonym, only means along main axe. But it also fine to use width

32. when 2 classes are the same to apply different property to each one use :nth-child(1) then 2 but need to wrap them in extra div

33. If in Figma does not show size use rectengular in order to know size

34. Vertical margin has issue if to put margin-bottom: 20 and margin-top: 30. Instead of margin: 50 will be largest margin: 30. Good practise to use always margin-bottom or margin-top.

35. For link apply padding and marging we have to use display: inline-block, because by default link is a span

36. To create space between leters using: letter-spacing: (1.1)em;

37. Slick slider written on JQuery, browser by itself does not understand JQ unless we specify to browser how to use JQ. We do it same way as we attached google fonts. Searching for "google jquery cdn"  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"></script> and paste it in html

38. <script> locate them before closing <body> because scripts are more resoursable, that is why need more time to load them. That is why for us more important to load content and only then script. Otherwise if we put them on top, once it load it will take few seconds and only then load content. Nobody will wait that long and go out from site.

39. Then we need to create and attach file like folder js with file main.js and connect it below JQ script

40. Structure of slider located in tab 'usage'. It need to be one parent div and childs div aka our images. In our example there are: bike-slider and bike-slider__item. 
Second we need to link slick.css but first we need to download it from slick website and copy slick.css to our styles folder.
Third same thing with slick.min.js 
Forth link css and js in html
! Our own styles.css need to be last from css links
! Same thing with connecting js; JQ first, then slick.min.js
Fifth. In main.js $(function () {$(".bike-slider").slick({});});
Six. There is some issues we have to add: max-width: 630px in .bike__column-slider
Seventh. We can also add theme from slick to chose how it gonna look.
Eights: In slick - settings we can customize: git rid of arrows or add dots.$(function () {$(".bike-slider").slick({arrows: false,dots: true,});});
Nines: Custumes dots, right click on them .slick-dots


position: absolute; allows to put it anywhere with properties top, right, bottom, left

41. To copy image from Figma: click on image -> Design -> Export -> select jpg

42. Applying padding-top: 50px; for all but first .info__item + .info__item
